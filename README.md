**ICME 2025 â€“ Cross-Structure and Semantic Enhancement for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) Grading**

## Prediction Instructions
1. Run `DataEnhanced.py` to perform two-stage data preprocessing. This will generate and save two versions of processed images along with their corresponding filenames.
2. Open `predict.py`, set the `DATA_PATH` in the `main()` function, and run the script to perform prediction.


## Notes
- Our model is inspired by [MVCINN](https://github.com/XiaolingLuo/MVCINN), where we followed the CNN-ViT hybrid structure but redesigned the basic blocks and introduced sub-band decomposition and KAN for enhanced representation.
- We partially initialized our model with their released weights, which may bring in some task-related prior knowledge, while some baselines were pretrained on ImageNet. We are trying to further analyze this and provide results trained from scratch in future updates.
- The current CS module computes dependencies **within each frequency**. We are working on enhancing this with **cross-frequency attention**.
